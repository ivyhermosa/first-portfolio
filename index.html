       <p> My Name is Ivy Hermosa. I was born and raised in the Philippines. I migrated here when I was 12 years old.
           Reason as to why, English is my third language to learn as a child. I have no prior knowledge to coding because
            I was a medical major before I joined this bootcamp. I decided to enroll to to this class becasue I wanted to learn
        a new skill that'll help me in the future. </p>
